The JavaFX coursework from Team Treehouse

This project is a follow-along for the [Team Treehouse Java course on JavaFX](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-javafx-application) GUI interface development. It's the last of the "Learn Java" library courses. 
I will attempt to commit each section's worth of code update at the end of each section, in a branch labeled as such, and then merge back into master as appropriate.
